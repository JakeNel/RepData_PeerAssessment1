## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
amd <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
```
Here is what the data looks like:

```{r}
head(amd)
str(amd)
```

The date variable needs to be converted into a date format.  
```{r}
amd$date <- as.Date(amd$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

##Verify that reformatting was successful

class(amd$date)
```

Lastly, group the data by date and time interval, using the group_by() function in the dplyr package. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
amd <- group_by(amd, date)
```
